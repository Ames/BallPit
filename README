BallPit

BallPit allows linking between the edges of browser windows. Bouncy balls created 
on one window or 'space' will bounce into linked spaces.

"Universal Attraction" gives all balls a variable amount of gravity.

Create a ball by dragging or pressing K or L.
If you don't want to think about all of the keybindings, just press Z.

- Server:
-- improve logging, perhaps make a semi-public gui to visualize the logs
-- make routing more efficient
-- if not routing, make SOMETHING more efficient...
